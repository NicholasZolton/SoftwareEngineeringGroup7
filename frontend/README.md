# Running This Project

First, make sure to go to the backend directory at `project/backend` and follow the steps there to get the API up and running.

Next, go ahead and run `npm install` in `project/frontend` to install all the dependencies.

Finally, run `npm run dev` to start the development server. This will start the frontend on a given port, and all
you need to do is go to the URL that is printed in the console to see the app (Ctrl+Click to open the link).
