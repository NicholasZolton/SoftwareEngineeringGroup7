# Java3DGraphicsEngine
A super lightweight Java 3D Graphics Engine.
It utilizes triangle rendering and was made entirely from scratch. Even the Vector class is coded personally.
Overall, it currently allows for the importation of certain obj files from Blender3D, but does not support color importation.
Feel free to use this however you'd like! It was made for educational purposes and all I ask is that that continues!
